Purpose

For Homework 07, you will be creating the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the game Minesweeper

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) using your JavaFX and Event-Driven Programming skills. We will provide you the program containing the logic of the game. You will be responsible for creating the interface for the user to play minesweeper.

Solution Description

We have provided MinesweeperGame.java which allows you to start and play a game of minesweeper through method calls. In addition, we have provided you with Tile.java and Difficulty.java which are used by MinesweeperGame.java. Check out the Homework 7 Appendix file for helpful details about these provided classes.

You will write MinesweeperView.java, which will display the board and allow users to use clicks to play the game, as well as show a start and end screen. You will also have to adhere to proper Checkstyle including Javadocs.

MinesweeperView.java

This file contains the MinesweeperView which will be the base for your JavaFX application. It will display the start screen where a user can start a game, the board where the user can play the game, and an end screen that displays the final result of the game. Please do not create multiple stages to display the different screens (this means only one window should be displayed throughout the entire game play, not including alerts). Your window must be reasonably sized. Your application must have the following properties:

‚Ä¢ The title of the window must be ‚ÄúMinesweeper‚Äù

‚Ä¢ The user, when first opening the application, should be greeted by the start screen. This should contain the following elements:

o A clearly labelled dropdown menu to select the difficulty: Easy, Medium, or Hard o A text input for the user to input their name. The text input must be clearly designated for the name.

o A clearly labelled start button. When this button is clicked:

If a value of the dropdown is selected AND a name is entered, proceed to the game screen.

Otherwise, inform the user that both fields are required and remain on the start screen. You should use a lambda expression to accomplish this functionality.

‚Ä¢ Once the user enters the game screen, create a new MinesweeperGame object. The game screen should have the following properties:

o The MinesweeperGame constructor should be called, and the difficulty selected on the start screen should be passed in. A Difficulty.java file containing an enum of the different difficulties has been provided.

o A 15√ó15 grid of buttons that represent the Tiles in the MinesweeperGame should be displayed. Each should be empty at first. o When a user clicks any of the tile buttons do the following. This handler should be implemented with an anonymous inner class:

Call the check(int y, int x) method of the MinesweeperGame that takes in the x and y index on the board (not the pixels) ‚Äì note the top left corner of the board is 0, 0.

ÔÉ† check() will return an array of Tile objects that the move revealed.

‚Ä¢ If the Tile clicked contained a mine, the array will be of length 1 and the Tile ‚Äòs isMine() method will return true.

‚Ä¢ Otherwise, each Tile object in the returned array will contain the x and y values of a Tile to reveal, and the number of surrounding mines for that Tile. These fields can be accessed using the getX(), getY(), and getBorderingMines() methods respectively. This represents, in the game, when the Tile clicked on is not a mine and there are a number of cells that can be revealed (not just the cell that was clicked).

‚Ä¢ Note: The returned array will always contain the Tile at the location that was clicked ‚Äì it will be the only Tile in the array when the clicked location is a mine and one of the Tile objects in the array when the clicked location is not a mine.

If the clicked location contained a mine, the game should end. A new screen should be displayed that reads ‚ÄúYou Lost, [Name of User]‚Äù. This screen should also contain a clearly labeled New Game button returning them to the Start screen of the application.

Use a named inner class to achieve the new game button functionality.

If the clicked location was not a mine, you should reveal each location on the grid that check returned, these should now display an integer value representing the number of surrounding mines.

Check if the user won the game, with MinesweeperGame‚Äôs isWon() method. If the user won, a new screen should be displayed that reads ‚ÄúCongratulations, [Name of User]‚Äù. This screen should also contain a clearly labeled New Game button returning them to the start screen of the application. Use a named inner class to achieve the new game button functionality. This inner class should be the same one used when the game is lost.

‚Ä¢ [Optional] Extra credit will be awarded for the following features: o Make a non-trivial addition to the program‚Äôs graphics that clearly extends its look (e.g. Make the visible tiles appear visually different from the tiles that have yet to be revealed or add animations to the ending screens).

o Make a non-trivial addition to the program‚Äôs controls or functionality that clearly extends its capabilities (e.g. Add a timer to the game or allow the user to add flags to the tiles they believe to be mines).

o You can choose to try for one, both, or neither of the above extra credit options. If you choose to go for the extra credit, attach a file named extra_credit.txt to your submission that explains exactly what additional features you have added.

o Note: Extra credit additions should NOT affect any of the required functionality!

You will find it useful to create helper methods to help you structure the logic of your program. Feel free to create as many helper methods as you would like but this is one way you can tackle the problem:

o start(Stage primaryStage)

Overrides the start() method from Application.

Creates a Scene for start screen and shows it on the Stage.

The start button‚Äôs lambda expression calls playMinesweeper() with the appropriate parameters if a name and difficulty are properly entered.

o playMinesweeper(Stage primaryStage, Difficulty gameDifficulty,

String name)

Creates another Scene where the user can play minesweeper and shows it on the passed in primaryStage.

You should construct a MinesweeperGame here with the passed in gameDifficulty. Create a grid of buttons (each of which represents a Tile), loop through each one, and use an anonymous inner class to set the handler for when it is clicked.

When the user wins or loses the game, create a new Scene to display the appropriate end screen using a private inner class and show it on the passed in primaryStage.

ÔÉ† Note: The private inner class that starts a new game cannot directly access the parameters of the playMinesweeper() method‚Äìyou might find it helpful to write a constructor.

Clarifications and Example Output

Please refer to the pinned Piazza thread for HW07 Clarifications for any necessary clarifications about the requirements outlined in this pdf. Some examples of the different screens of the game are shown below:

Allowed Imports:

You are allowed to import anything from the javafx library for this assignment.

Feature Restrictions

There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or break our auto grader. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:

‚Ä¢ var‚ÄØ(the reserved keyword)

‚Ä¢ System.exit

‚Ä¢ Scene Builder

Checkstyle and Javadocs

You will need to write Javadocs for this assignment and all following homeworks as well as run Checkstyle for Javadocs.

You must run Checkstyle on your submission. The Checkstyle cap for this assignment is 15 points. If you don‚Äôt have Checkstyle yet, download it from Canvas -&gt; Modules -&gt; Checkstyle Resources (all sections) Place it in the same folder as the files you want Checkstyled. Run checkstyle on your code like so:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar yourFileName.java Starting audit‚Ä¶ Audit done.

The message above means there were no Checkstyle errors. If you had any errors, they would show up above this message, and the number at the end would be the points we would take off (limited by the Checkstyle cap mentioned above). The Java source files we provide contain no Checkstyle errors. In future homeworks we will be increasing this cap, so get into the habit of fixing these style errors early!

Additionally, you must Javadoc your code.

Run the following to only check your Javadocs:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -j yourFileName.java

Run the following to check both Javadocs and Checkstyle:

$ java -jar checkstyle-8.28.jar -a yourFileName.java

For additional help with Checkstyle see the CS 1331 Style Guide.

Collaboration

No collaboration is allowed on this assignment. See syllabus for more details.

Turn-In Procedure

Submission

To submit, upload the files listed below to the corresponding assignment on Gradescope:

‚Ä¢ MinesweeperView.java

‚Ä¢ extra_credit.txt (if you choose to try for the extra credit)

Gradescope‚ÄØAutograder

For each submission, you will be able to see the results of a few basic test cases on your code. Each test typically corresponds to a rubric item, and the score returned represents the performance of your code on those rubric items only. If you fail a test, you can look at the output to determine what went wrong and resubmit once you have fixed the issue.

The‚ÄØGradescope‚ÄØtests serve two main purposes:

‚Ä¢ Prevent upload mistakes (e.g. non-compiling code)

‚Ä¢ Provide basic formatting and usage validation

In other words, the test cases on‚ÄØGradescope‚ÄØare by no means comprehensive. Be sure to thoroughly test your code by considering edge cases and writing your own test files. You also should avoid using‚ÄØGradescope‚ÄØto compile, run, or‚ÄØCheckstyle‚ÄØyour code; you can do that locally on your machine.

‚Ä¢ Non-compiling files will receive a 0 for all associated rubric items

‚Ä¢ Do not submit‚ÄØ.class‚ÄØfiles

‚Ä¢ Test your code in addition to the basic checks on‚ÄØGradescope

‚Ä¢ Run‚ÄØCheckstyle‚ÄØon your code to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Submit every file each time you resubmit

‚Ä¢ Read the ‚ÄúAllowed Imports‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeature Restrictions‚Äù to avoid losing points

‚Ä¢ Check on Piazza for a note containing all official clarifications
